## Application Structure

The icons from the design were exported as svg in `src/icons` folder. Using SVGR, the components for corresponding icons were created in `src/components/icons` folder.

For each page in the application, main components were created in `src/views` folder. 

Created sub-components such as button, card, header, input, search, and tab bar in `src/components` folder to use in the main components.

Also, created `src/utils/theme.js` file to specify sizes, colors, and radii to standardize these values.

Navigation was handled in `src/navigation.js` file.
